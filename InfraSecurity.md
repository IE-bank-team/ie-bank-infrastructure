# IE Bank Infrastructure Security Policy

## Overview
This document delineates the security procedures and policies governing the IE Infrastructure. Our objective is to establish a robust framework for addressing security vulnerabilities and providing comprehensive guidelines for both contributors and users. This ensures the project's integrity and safety. To uphold our commitment to robust security, we have implemented advanced practices and tools, leveraging GitHub's Advanced Security features, such as CodeQL for semantic code analysis and Dependabot for dependency management.

If you discover a potential security vulnerability within our project, we encourage you to promptly report it. Our dedicated team is committed to addressing security concerns urgently and discreetly. We aim to acknowledge and respond to security reports within 72 hours. Refer to the subsequent sections for detailed reporting guidelines.

## Security Configurations
We strongly recommend that users and team members adhere to specific security-related configurations to bolster the overall security of the project. Team members and contributors can request detailed instructions and guidelines for secure configurations, aligning with our overarching security protocols and best practices.

## Identifying Security Gaps & Future Improvements
Acknowledging the dynamic nature of software security, we actively engage in:

- Continuous monitoring and assessment of the code for vulnerabilities.
- Timely implementation of updates and patches to address known issues.
- Future enhancements focusing on fortifying our security infrastructure and expanding vulnerability detection capabilities.
